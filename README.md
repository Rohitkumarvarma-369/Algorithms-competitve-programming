1. Check if the given number is a palindrome
2. Count the number of digits in a given number in three different ways
3. Basic hashing of storing the occurences in a string into a frequency array with time complexity of O(n)+O(256)
4. Basic hashing of storing the occurences in a string into a map data structure with time complexity of O(n*logn)+O(256)
5. Prefix sum
6. Scanline algorithm 1d
7. Iterative approach to find factorial of a number
8. Recursive approach to find factorial of a number
9. Finding number of trailing zeroes in a number's factorial in O(Log(n)) time complexity
10. Find HCF of two numbers using Euclidean Algorithm (TIme complexity: O(Log min(a, b)))
11. Naive approach to find the lcm of two numbers. time complexity: O((a*b)-max(a,b))
12. Efficient approach to find the lcm of two numbers using the relation a*b = gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b); time complexity:O(log(min(a,b)))
13. Naive approach to check if a given number is a prime number. Time complexity: O(n)
14. Efficient approach to check if a given number is a prime number. Time complexity: O(sq.root(n)) and this also further enhanced by adding simple divisibility checks to check if the number is divisible by 2 and 3, this reduces the time complexity by 1/3rd of just square root method.
15. Naive approach to implement a function to find the prime factors of a given number
Efficient approach to find the prime factors of a given number. Time complexity: O(sq.root(n)) to O(sq.root(n)/3)
